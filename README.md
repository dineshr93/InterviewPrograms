Picnic company has conducted an  interview process
I completed the programs but time is over,

So I thought of not wasting my solutions..
So Added here

ArrayToIntandInttoarray.java has 2 functions

1. Ability to convert an integer array into an Int
Eg. Input : a[1,2,3]  
    Output: 123  
2. Ability to convert an int to integer array
Eg. Input : 123
   Output : a[1,2,3]  
    
FirstLast.java has below goal (Also has used one of the above function)

1. If integer Input: 1234 then Output: 1423  
2. If integer Input: 12345 then Output: 15243


ArraySort.java finds the small and large element in array

1. O(N) time complexity
2. Not using any sort functionality

Example:
Input : -8,3,5,1,0,2,-1,-2,
Output:
Small Element is -8
large Element is 5
